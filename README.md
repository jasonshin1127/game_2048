# game_2048
2048 is a matching game where your job is to combine matching tiles to create larger numbered tiles.


In 2048 you only have four main gestures: up, down, left, and right. Every time you swipe, every tile on the board moves in that position as far as it possibly can. If multiple cards can combine at once, they will do so. Keep this in mind and understand how moves work before swiping a tile that may or may not end up where you thought it would.
